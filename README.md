# coding-for-fun
Just some random codes I did during my spare time
randomgen.py is an example of how to call an API with python with JSON params
validity.py is some codes for random challenges found online

Need some of these libraries:
PIL : pip install Pillow
Rethink : Download from RethinkDB website
GoLang : Download from GoLang website
After that use 'go get' to get all the dependencies in the GO files
For example, go get github.com/dancannon/gorethink
