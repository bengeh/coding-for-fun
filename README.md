Just some random codes I did during my spare time
randomgen.py is an example of how to call an API with python with JSON params
validity.py is some codes for random challenges found online


Each file indicates a language I have used to solve some problems (could be from leetcode/ hackerrank/ etc)
Go stuff: problems solved with GoLang
Java stuff: problems solved with Java
Javascript stuff: problems solved with Javascript
Python stuff: problems solved with Python

There are some questions which I just did on the leetcode/hackerrank website... 
So... if interested.. 
leetcode profile: https://leetcode.com/benjamingeh1993/
hackerrank profile: https://www.hackerrank.com/benjamingeh1993


Need some of these libraries:
PIL : pip install Pillow
Rethink : Download from RethinkDB website
GoLang : Download from GoLang website
After that use 'go get' to get all the dependencies in the GO files
For example, go get github.com/dancannon/gorethink
